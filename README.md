# Capstone-Analysis-Square
Download and run the python and HTML files for Dream Team's Capstone project here. 

I recommend downloading the HTML file and then accessing it via a Chromium browser (this includes, but isn't limited to, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Brave)

This is a landscape analysis of Startup Funding plus interest in the Payments industry.

StartUp Investments (Crunchbase): https://www.kaggle.com/arindam235/startup-investments-crunchbase

The dataset used for this analysis was downloaded from Kaggle but the source of the data is from Crunchbase. The site contains financial information and funding rounds for private and public companies involved in services such as payments and BNPL.


The dataset consists financial data relating to investments in startups. This data includes:

startup name
url
market category
status (operating, acquired, closed)
location: country, city, region
funding: total funding in usd, type of funding (including, but not limited to, seed, angel, debt taken, venture capital, & funding rounds)


The goal of this workbook is to provide a financial analysis on companies in the fintech space. We specifically concentrated on companies that specialize in finance, payments, and BNPL to see where companies such as Afterpay and Klarna have performed in the space, and how Square stands to benefit from entering this market.
